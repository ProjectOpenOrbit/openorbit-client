# OpenOrbit Client
This is the main repository for the actual OpenOrbit gameclient.

This repository will be filled with life, as soon as the current state of the project will be stripped of any copyrighted material.

# Structural Overview

This board should give a good overview of how the client will be structures and, most important, give you a feeling for the TODOs.
